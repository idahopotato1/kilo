# Examples

The examples in this directory demonstrate various features of kilo. The
examples are not strictly ordered, though they do attempt to build on earlier
examples.

The first few examples are done in an imperative way with everything in one
simple script. Later examples demonstrate using kilo in a more 'production'
environment.

## Usage

Each example may be run by navigating to its directory, installing npm packages,
then starting the example.

```shell
$ cd kilo/examples/##-Example
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
